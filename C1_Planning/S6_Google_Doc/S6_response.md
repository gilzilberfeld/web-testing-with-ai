I can't directly create a Google Doc for you. My capabilities are limited to providing text-based responses.

However, you can easily create a Google Doc yourself using the content I've provided:

1.  **Copy the entire test plan document** from my previous response.
2.  Go to **Google Docs** (docs.google.com).
3.  Click on **"+ Blank document"** or start a new document.
4.  **Paste the copied content** into the new Google Doc.

All the formatting (headings, bullet points, bold text, etc.) should largely carry over, though you might need to make minor adjustments to ensure it looks exactly as you'd like.

Let me know if you need any other assistance with the content itself!
