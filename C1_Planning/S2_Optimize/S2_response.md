**Optimization Strategies Used:**

* **Batching Similar Tests:** Grouping all negative login tests together, or all negative checkout form validations.
* **Minimizing Logins:** Logging in once at the start of a workflow and performing multiple actions before logging out.
* **Leveraging Existing State:** For example, adding products to the cart and then immediately testing cart removal or checkout, instead of starting fresh for each.
* **Chaining Dependent Tests:** Testing removal of a product *after* adding one.
* **Focus Areas:** Each workflow has a primary focus (e.g., login, cart, checkout), making it easier to manage and debug if failures occur.

These workflows provide a structured and efficient way to test bstackdemo.com. Remember to document your actual results for each step!
