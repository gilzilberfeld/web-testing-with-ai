When checking for multiple users using the system, you're essentially moving into the realm of **Concurrency Testing**, **Load Testing**, and **Stress Testing**. Functional test cases, like the ones provided, are typically run with a single user to verify correctness. When you introduce multiple users, you're looking for how the system *performs* and *behaves* under concurrent access.

Since bstackdemo.com uses a single, shared login (`demouser`/`testingisfun99`), this simplifies things a bit, as you don't need to manage multiple user accounts. However, it also means you're limited in testing scenarios where different users interact with distinct data (e.g., user A's cart vs. user B's cart, if they were separate accounts).

Here's how you'd approach multi-user testing for bstackdemo.com, focusing on what's testable with the given setup:

### Cases to Add for Multiple Users (Concurrency/Load Testing)

These cases are specifically designed to be run **concurrently** by multiple "virtual users." This typically requires specialized tools (like JMeter, k6, LoadRunner, etc.) that can simulate many users interacting with the system simultaneously, rather than manual browser testing.

1.  **Concurrent Valid Logins:**
    * **Scenario:** Multiple users (e.g., 50, 100, 500) attempt to log in using `demouser`/`testingisfun99` at the exact same time.
    * **Expected:** All users should be able to log in successfully within an acceptable response time. No login failures due to concurrency.

2.  **Concurrent Product Browse:**
    * **Scenario:** Multiple users simultaneously browse products, navigating through categories (if available) and viewing product details.
    * **Expected:** Page load times remain consistent and acceptable. No errors or display issues.

3.  **Concurrent "Add to Cart" Operations:**
    * **Scenario:** Multiple users simultaneously add different products to their carts (or even the same product).
    * **Expected:** All "Add to Cart" operations complete successfully. The cart counts update correctly for each user. There should be no "race conditions" where one user's add to cart interferes with another's.

4.  **Concurrent Checkout Process (Up to Shipping Details):**
    * **Scenario:** Multiple users concurrently proceed from their carts to the checkout page and fill in shipping details.
    * **Expected:** The checkout form loads quickly for all users. Input fields are responsive.

5.  **Concurrent "Place Order" Submissions:**
    * **Scenario:** Multiple users, having filled in their checkout details, simultaneously click "Place Order."
    * **Expected:** All orders are processed successfully without conflicts or data corruption. Order confirmation pages load correctly. This is a critical point for potential database contention.

6.  **Sustained Load - Mixed Operations:**
    * **Scenario:** A defined number of users (e.g., 50, 100) continuously perform a mix of actions: login, browse products, add to cart, remove from cart, and complete orders over a period of time (e.g., 10-30 minutes).
    * **Expected:** System remains stable, response times are within acceptable limits, no errors, no memory leaks or resource exhaustion on the server.

7.  **Stress Testing - Breaking Point:**
    * **Scenario:** Gradually increase the number of concurrent users until the system's performance degrades significantly (e.g., very slow response times, high error rates) or it crashes.
    * **Expected:** Identify the maximum capacity of the system before it breaks. Understand how it recovers after high load.

### Which of the Suggested Cases Would You Run Also in Multi-User Mode?

For multi-user testing, you primarily focus on the *performance and stability* aspects of the functional flows. You wouldn't typically run every single negative functional test case (e.g., "Empty Username" 100 times concurrently) unless you suspect a specific vulnerability related to concurrent invalid inputs.

Here are the suggested cases that are most relevant to run in a multi-user (concurrency/load) mode:

* **From Workflow 1: Core Functionality - Happy Path & Essential Validations**
    * **Valid Login:** Crucial for measuring login concurrency and server capacity under typical login load.
    * **Add Multiple Different Products to Cart:** Tests concurrent cart manipulation.
    * **Successful Order with Multiple Items:** The most critical concurrent operation, testing database integrity and transaction processing under load.

* **From Workflow 3: Cart Manipulation & Product Page Interaction**
    * **View Products:** Essential for measuring general page load performance under load.
    * **Add Single Product to Cart / Add Multiple Quantities of the Same Product:** These actions are part of the core shopping flow and should be included in load scenarios.
    * **Remove Product from Cart:** Checks concurrent cart updates.

* **From Workflow 5: Price and Order Integrity Checks**
    * **Total Price Calculation / Currency Display:** While not a load test in itself, these are the *assertions* you'd make during your concurrent "add to cart" and "place order" tests to ensure data consistency even under load. You're checking that the calculations remain correct for each user.

**In summary, for multi-user testing, you would automate the common "happy path" user journeys and key transactional processes (login, add to cart, checkout, place order) and run them concurrently with many virtual users.** The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, resource consumption issues, and potential race conditions or data integrity problems that only manifest under concurrent access. You'd measure metrics like:

* **Response Times:** How quickly pages and API calls respond.
* **Throughput:** Number of requests/transactions per second.
* **Error Rates:** Percentage of failed requests.
* **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, network, database usage on the server side.
