### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for `bstackdemo.com`, a sample e-commerce website. The purpose of this test plan is to define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for testing the website, ensuring its quality, functionality, performance, and user experience.

### 2. Scope

The scope of this test plan covers the key user flows and functionalities of the `bstackdemo.com` application from a customer's perspective. This includes the login process, product Browse, cart management, and the end-to-end ordering process. Non-functional aspects such as performance, security, usability, compatibility, and accessibility will also be addressed.

### 3. Test Items

The primary test item is the `bstackdemo.com` web application, accessible via:
* Main login page: `https://bstackdemo.com/signin`
* Products page: `https://bstackdemo.com/` (after login)

### 4. Features to be Tested

The following features and functionalities will be thoroughly tested:

#### 4.1. Login Functionality
* **Valid Login:** Successful login with provided credentials (`demouser`/`testingisfun99`).
* **Invalid Login:** Handling of incorrect usernames, incorrect passwords, empty fields, and case sensitivity.
* **UI/UX:** Tab key navigation, Enter key submission.

#### 4.2. Product Browse and Cart Management

* **Add to Cart:** Adding single, multiple different, and multiple quantities of the same product.
* **Cart Review:** Viewing selected items in the cart.
* **Remove from Cart:** Removing individual items or all items from the cart.
* **Cart Persistence:** Verification that cart items remain after navigation or page refresh.
* **Empty Cart State:** Behavior when the cart is empty, including checkout attempts.
* **Search/Filter/Sort:** (If applicable) Testing functionality for searching, filtering, and sorting products.

#### 4.3. Ordering Process (Checkout)
* **Successful Order:** Completing an order with single and multiple items using valid shipping and payment details.

* **Payment Method Selection:** Validation of payment method selection.
* **Back Button Functionality:** Behavior when using the browser's back button during checkout.
* **Price and Order Integrity:** Verification of correct total price calculation and currency display.
* **Order History:** (If applicable) Verification of placed orders in an "Order History" section.
* **Logout after Order:** Correct logout behavior after a successful order.

#### 4.4. Multi-User/Concurrency (Load & Stress)
* **Concurrent Logins:** Multiple users logging in simultaneously.
* **Concurrent Product Browse:** Multiple users viewing products concurrently.
* **Concurrent "Add to Cart" Operations:** Multiple users adding items to their carts at the same time.
* **Concurrent "Place Order" Submissions:** Multiple users completing their orders simultaneously.
* **Sustained Load:** System stability and performance under a prolonged period of concurrent mixed operations.
* **Stress Testing:** Identifying the system's breaking point and recovery mechanism under extreme load.

#### 4.5. Non-Functional Behavior
* **Performance:**
    * Load testing (response times, throughput, resource utilization, error rates under expected load).
    * Stress testing (system degradation, crash point, recovery).
    * Scalability testing (how performance improves with resources).
    * Spike testing (handling sudden traffic surges).
* **Security:**
    * Authentication & Authorization (brute-force protection, session management).
    * Input Validation (SQL Injection, XSS attempts on form fields).
    * Data Transmission Security (HTTPS enforcement, sensitive data exposure).
    * Error Handling (no sensitive info in error messages).
* **Usability:**
    * Learnability (ease for new users).
    * Efficiency (speed of task completion for experienced users).
    * Error Prevention & Recovery (clear error messages, ability to correct inputs).
* **Compatibility:**
    * Browser Compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest stable versions).
    * Operating System Compatibility (Windows, macOS).
    * Device Compatibility / Responsive Design (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile - various resolutions).
* **Accessibility:**
    * Keyboard Navigation (Tab, Enter, Spacebar).
    * Screen Reader Compatibility (images `alt` text, form labels).
    * Color Contrast.
    * Zoom Functionality.

### 5. Features Not to be Tested

The following areas are considered out of scope for this test plan:
* Real payment gateway integration and processing (as the site uses dummy payment).
* User registration (as the site provides fixed login credentials).
* Password reset/forgot password functionality.
* Advanced administrative functionalities (if any exist but are not exposed to public users).
* Integration with external systems beyond the core e-commerce flow.
* Deep database integrity checks beyond what is observable from the UI.

### 6. Test Approach

The testing approach will be a combination of manual and automated testing:

* **Manual Testing:** Primarily for UI/UX, exploratory testing, accessibility checks, and initial verification of functional flows.
* **Automated Functional Testing:** For repetitive functional test cases (e.g., valid/invalid login, adding items, checkout happy path).
* **Performance Testing:** Utilizing specialized tools (e.g., JMeter, k6) to simulate multi-user load and analyze performance metrics.
* **Security Testing:** Manual penetration testing techniques for common vulnerabilities like injection and XSS. Automated scanning tools may be used if available.
* **Compatibility Testing:** Running tests across a matrix of browsers, OS, and devices.
* **Accessibility Testing:** Using a combination of manual checks, browser extensions (e.g., Lighthouse, WAVE), and screen readers.

Testing will follow an iterative approach, with regression testing conducted after each significant build or bug fix.

### 7. Item Pass/Fail Criteria

* **Pass:**
    * The test item meets all defined requirements and behaves as expected.
    * No critical or major defects are found.
    * Performance metrics are within acceptable thresholds under specified load.
    * Security vulnerabilities are not detected in high/critical severity.
    * The system is stable and usable across defined environments.
* **Fail:**
    * The test item does not meet one or more defined requirements or behaves unexpectedly.
    * A critical or major defect is identified.
    * Performance metrics fall outside acceptable thresholds.
    * Significant security vulnerabilities are identified.
    * The system is unstable or unusable in specified environments.

### 8. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements

* **Suspension Criteria:** Testing will be suspended if:
    * A critical blocking defect is found that prevents further testing of core functionalities (e.g., inability to log in, add items to cart, or proceed to checkout).
    * The test environment becomes unstable or unavailable.
    * The build under test is significantly unstable, leading to a high rate of unrelated failures.
* **Resumption Requirements:** Testing will resume when:
    * A new, stable build addressing the blocking defects is deployed.
    * The test environment is restored to a stable state.
    * The identified issues are resolved and verified by the development team.
