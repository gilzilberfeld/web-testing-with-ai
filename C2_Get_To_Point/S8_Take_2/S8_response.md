You are absolutely correct! My apologies for that typo.

The method name in Playwright is `wait_for_load_state` with an underscore, not `wait_for_loadstate`. I'll fix that in the script for you.

Here's the corrected Playwright script:

```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import Playwright, async_playwright, expect

async def exploratory_test_add_products(playwright: Playwright) -> None:
    # Launch browser
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False) # Set headless=False to see the browser
    page = await browser.new_page()
    page.set_default_timeout(10000) # Set a default timeout for actions

    print("Navigating to login page...")
    await page.goto("https://bstackdemo.com/signin")
    # Corrected: wait_for_load_state instead of wait_for_loadstate
    await page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # Wait for the page to be fully loaded

    print("Logging in...")
    # Fill username and password
    await page.fill("input[type='text'][name='username']", "demouser")
    await page.fill("input[type='password'][name='password']", "testingisfun99")

    # Click the Sign In button
    await page.click("#login-btn")

    # Wait for navigation to the products page after successful login
    await page.wait_for_url("https://bstackdemo.com/")
    await page.wait_for_selector(".shelf-container", state="visible") # Wait for products to load
    print("Successfully logged in and on products page.")

    print("Adding selected iPhone and Galaxy models to cart...")

    # Function to add a product to cart by its name
    async def add_product_to_cart(product_name: str):
        try:
            product_card_locator = page.locator(f"//p[text()='{product_name}']/ancestor::div[contains(@class, 'shelf-item')]")
            add_to_cart_button = product_card_locator.locator(".buy-btn")

            # Ensure the button is visible and enabled before clicking
            await expect(add_to_cart_button).to_be_visible()
            await expect(add_to_cart_button).to_be_enabled()

            await add_to_cart_button.click()
            print(f"Added '{product_name}' to cart.")

            # Optional: Wait for the cart count to update or a notification
            await page.wait_for_selector("#cart-count", state="visible")
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5) # Small pause for visual confirmation
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Could not add '{product_name}' to cart. Error: {e}")


    # Add specific iPhone models
    await add_product_to_cart("iPhone 12")
    await add_product_to_cart("iPhone 13")

    # Add specific Galaxy models
    await add_product_to_cart("Galaxy S9")
    await add_product_to_cart("Galaxy Note 20")

    print("\nProducts added. You can now perform your exploratory testing.")
    print("The browser will remain open for your manual interaction.")

# To run the script:
# 1. Make sure you have Playwright installed: `pip install playwright`
# 2. Install browser binaries: `playwright install`
# 3. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `exploratory_test.py`)
# 4. Run from your terminal: `python -m playwright test exploratory_test.py`
#    (or simply `python exploratory_test.py` if you manage the event loop,
#    but `playwright test` is recommended for async Playwright scripts)
async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await exploratory_test_add_products(playwright)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The only change was on line 12:
`await page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')`

This should resolve the `AttributeError`.
