Create two tests, for the login screen.
The first one for successful login, which succeeds if navigates to the product page.
The second one for invalid login (wrong user), which succeeds when the error message is shown.

Use the following:
- User Playwright
- Use the sync APIs
- Find locators by roles
- Skip the explanations and comments in the test body

Make sure the tests work!
